This is a computer setup guide for the MSI GT72VR 7RF student laptop. It will make the computer more useful and also a bit faster. If you are using a different computer jump to step 3 and ignore the point about "MSI true color".

## Step 1
Complete the windows setup and update to the latest version. This will take quite a while. Talk to your classmates while you wait.

## Step 2
Removing the worst of the bloatware will make your computer much faster so go to "Settings" -> "Apps" and uninstall the following:
- Norton Antivirus
- Norton Backup
- Candy Crush
- March of Empires
- Killer
- Steel series engine
- WinZip (a bug in the installed version prevents files default programs to reset)
- Microsoft OneDrive (If your not planning on using it)


## Step 3
Adjust some annoying settings.
- Change Windows 10 language using [this guide](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-properly-change-system-default-language-windows-10).
  - After reboot, right click on the word ENG in the down right corner, open setting and set Swedish keyboard as default.
- Turn of desktop partition and MSI true color.
   - Right click on your desktop and select "MSI true color" -> show settings -> tools -> Desktop partition -> off
   - Options -> run at system start-up -> off
   - Options -> Games -> Game Field -> off
- Open a explorer window (Win + E) and select "View" -> file name extensions - > on
- Right click the battery in the down right corner and select "Power Options" -> Change plan settings
  - On battery I have 5 minutes on screen and 10 minutes to sleep.
  - Connected I have 10 minutes on screen and 30 minutes to sleep.



## Step 4
Download and install the following programs if you get a choice of version, it's 64 bit windows that's preferable.

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) (or update the browser of your choice)
- [Unity3D](https://store.unity.com/)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/downloading) (optional)
- [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
- [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
- [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)
- Text editor of choice
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/) (My current choice)
  - [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) (Also very good)

## Step 5
Activate the Linux terminal (useful for GIT and much more) using [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/).

## Step 6
If you have any additional suggestion for this guide please let the teacher know.

## Step 7
Check for windows updates again, they have probably released 3 new one since you started. Update and restart.
